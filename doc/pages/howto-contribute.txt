Section: Asset management

remoteStorage.js contains a few assets (CSS, images) for the widget. Those can be found in the top-level directory assets/. To reduce the number of files needed to include remoteStorage.js in an app, assets are being pulled into the JavaScript before being used. The resulting file is src/lib/assets.js.

Adding a new asset:

* Create a file in assets/
  > echo "#something { background:blue; }" > assets/somethingCss.css
* Build assets.js
  > make compile-assets
* Access the asset data
  (start code)
  define(['lib/assets'], function(assets) {
    return {
      buildSomethign: function() {
        var something = document.createElement('style');
        something.innerHTML = assets.somethingCss;
        return something;
      }
    }
  });
  (end code)

How are assets included?:

* build/compile-assets.js decides how to include the asset based on the file-extension.
* PNG and SVG files are included as data URIs, so they can directly be used as values for the "src" attribute of an "img" element.
* All other files are stored as raw octets, with the exception of newlines being replaced by spaces.

If you wish to add an asset a different way, please alter build/compile-assets.js according to you needs.
